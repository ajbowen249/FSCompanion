# SimConnect Bridge

This is the main bridge point to enable other apps/remote devices to connect
through SimConnect using a web-based protocol. The idea here is to provide a
developmental disconnect and reusable gateway as additional interface are
created.

**NOTE** This assumes that the Microsoft FlightSimulator (2020) SDK has been
installed, and that the SimConnect SDK lives in the standard place at

    C:\MSFS SDK\SimConnect SDK
